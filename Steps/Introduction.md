# Introduction

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. In a stack, the last element added is the first one to be removed. It's like a stack of plates, where you can only add or remove plates from the top of the stack.

A stack is used to store and manage a collection of elements with the following primary operations:

1. **Push:** Adding an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop:** Removing and returning the top element from the stack.
3. **Peek:** Examining the top element without removing it.
4. **IsEmpty:** Checking if the stack is empty.
5. **IsFull:** Checking if the stack is full (in a fixed-size stack).

Stacks have various practical applications, including:

1. **Function Call Management:** Stacks are used by programming languages and operating systems to manage function calls. When a function is called, its local variables and execution context are pushed onto the call stack. When the function returns, the context is popped, allowing the program to resume where it left off.

2. **Expression Evaluation:** Stacks are used to evaluate expressions, including arithmetic expressions and parsing expressions. Operators and operands are pushed and popped from the stack as the expression is evaluated.

3. **Undo/Redo Functionality:** Stacks can be used to implement undo and redo functionality in applications. The state of an application at different points in time is pushed onto the stack, and users can undo or redo actions by popping and pushing states.

4. **Backtracking and Algorithms:** Stacks are used in algorithms that involve backtracking, such as depth-first search and recursive algorithms. They can help keep track of the state or decisions made during traversal.

5. **Memory Management:** In computer memory management, a stack is used for tracking the allocation and deallocation of memory blocks. When variables or objects are pushed onto the stack, memory is allocated, and when they are popped, memory is deallocated.

6. **Browser History:** Web browsers use stacks to keep track of the pages visited. Each time you navigate to a new page, the URL is pushed onto the stack. You can then use the back and forward buttons to pop and push URLs to navigate through the history.

Stacks are a fundamental data structure with a wide range of applications in computer science and programming, particularly in scenarios where you need to keep track of elements in a last-in, first-out manner.
