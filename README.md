# Comprehensive Tutorial on Creating a Stack in C#

## Introduction

This tutorial delves into the concept of a stack, its implementation in C#, and its practical applications. We'll cover the basics of stack operations with examples in C#.

### What is a Stack?

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It allows for adding (pushing) and removing (popping) elements only from the top of the stack.

### Implementing a Stack in C#

**Example: Basic Stack Implementation**
```csharp
public class CustomStack<T>
{
    private class StackNode
    {
        public T Data;
        public StackNode Next;

        public StackNode(T data)
        {
            Data = data;
            Next = null;
        }
    }

    private StackNode _top;

    public CustomStack()
    {
        _top = null;
    }

    // Push: Add an element to the top of the stack
    public void Push(T data)
    {
        StackNode newNode = new StackNode(data);
        newNode.Next = _top;
        _top = newNode;
    }

    // Pop: Remove and return the top element of the stack
    public T Pop()
    {
        if (_top == null) throw new InvalidOperationException("Stack is empty");

        T value = _top.Data;
        _top = _top.Next;
        return value;
    }

    // Peek: Return the top element of the stack without removing it
    public T Peek()
    {
        if (_top == null) throw new InvalidOperationException("Stack is empty");
        return _top.Data;
    }
}
```

### Stack Operations

- **Push:** Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop:** Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
- **Peek:** Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.

### Understanding the Stack Data Structure

Stacks are used in scenarios where you need to maintain a collection of items with LIFO access. This is especially useful in algorithms where the most recent data is the most relevant.

### Real-World Applications

- Undo mechanisms in software: Stacks are used to keep track of operations for undo functionality.
- Expression evaluation: Stacks are widely used in parsing and evaluating expressions in programming languages.
- Function call management: Call stacks in programming languages manage function calls and returns.

### Conclusion

Implementing a stack in C# provides a robust and efficient way to handle LIFO-type data operations. Stacks are versatile and are used in various applications ranging from simple data management to complex algorithm implementations.
